# AI-Spam-Detection-System
The AI Spam Detection System is an intelligent web-based application designed to automatically identify and classify spam messages or files using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning. Built with Python (Flask framework) and integrated with a responsive front-end interface, the system allows users to input text or upload files for real-time spam detection.


Tools & Technologies: Python, Flask, SQLite, HTML/CSS/JS, Flask-WTF, Flask-Mail, SQLAlchemy, TensorFlow


Role / Contributions:

Designed the complete system architecture, database schema, and detection pipeline.

Implemented machine learning models for text classification and spam identification.

Integrated geolocation functionality to track the origin of spam content.

Developed secure authentication (login/signup) and feedback modules using Flask-WTF and Flask-Login.

Conducted testing for performance, reliability, and data security to ensure robustness.


Achievements & Highlights:

Achieved 97% detection accuracy using optimized NLP and ML techniques.

Integrated email notification and geolocation tracking for detected spam entries.

Developed a user-friendly web interface with strong security (SQL injection & XSS protection).

Recognized as one of the top-performing Final Year Projects (FYP) within the department.

Designed for scalability and multi-user performance with <5s response time per detection.


Future Scope:

Integration with AI-based phishing and scam detection systems.

Deployment on cloud servers (AWS/Heroku) for public accessibility.

Expansion to handle multimedia spam (images, links, voice data).
